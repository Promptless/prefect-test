    <Tip>
    **Default Docker build namespace**
        After infrastructure provisioning completes, you are logged into your new Azure Container Registry and 
        the default Docker build namespace is set to the URL of the registry.
    </Tip>

        While the default namespace is set, any images you build without specifying a registry or username/organization 
        are pushed to the registry.

        To use this capability, write your deploy scripts like this:

        ```python example_deploy_script.py
        from prefect import flow
        from prefect.docker import DockerImage                                


        @flow(log_prints=True)                                                         
        def my_flow(name: str = "world"):
            print(f"Hello {name}! I'm a flow running on an Azure Container Instance!") 


        if __name__ == "__main__":
            my_flow.deploy(                                                            
                name="my-deployment",
                work_pool_name="my-work-pool",                                    
                image=DockerImage(                                                 
                    name="my-image:latest",                                       
                    platform="linux/amd64",                                            
                )                                                                 
            )       
        ```

        This builds an image with the tag `<acr-registry-url>/my-image:latest` and pushes it to the registry.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Google Cloud Run">

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:

  <Tab title="Google Cloud Run">

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:
### Work pool status

Work pools have three statuses:

- `READY`: A work pool has at least one online worker sending heartbeats to the work pool.
- `NOT_READY`: A work pool has no online workers.
- `PAUSED`: You can place a work pool in a paused status manually or through an automation. When a paused work pool is unpaused, it is reassigned the 
appropriate status based on whether any workers are sending heartbeats.

```

        While the default namespace is set, any images you build without specifying a registry or username/organization

### Manage concurrency

Each work pool can optionally restrict concurrent runs of matching flows.

For example, a work pool with a concurrency limit of 5 only releases new work if fewer than five matching runs are in a 
`Running` or `Pending` state. If three runs are `Running` or `Pending`, polling the pool for work only results in two new runs—
even if there are many more available, to ensure that the concurrency limit is not exceeded.

When using the `prefect work-pool` Prefect CLI command to configure a work pool, the following subcommands set concurrency limits:

- `set-concurrency-limit`  sets a concurrency limit on a work pool
- `clear-concurrency-limit` clears any concurrency limits from a work pool

    For advanced use cases, create work pools with fully customizable job templates. This customization is available when 
    creating or editing a work pool on the 'Advanced' tab within the UI or when updating a work pool via the Prefect CLI.

    Advanced customization is useful anytime the underlying infrastructure supports a high degree of customization. 
    In these scenarios a work pool job template allows you to expose a minimal and easy-to-digest set of options to deployment authors. 
    Additionally, these options are the _only_ customizable aspects for deployment infrastructure, which are useful for restricting 
    capabilities in secure environments. For example, the `kubernetes` worker type allows users to specify a custom job template  
    to configure the manifest that workers use to create jobs for flow execution.

    See more information about [overriding a work pool's job variables](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/customize).

        This builds an image with the tag `<acr-registry-url>/my-image:latest` and pushes it to the registry.

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:
