    <Tip>
    **Default Docker build namespace**
        After infrastructure provisioning completes, you are logged into your new Azure Container Registry and 
        the default Docker build namespace is set to the URL of the registry.
    </Tip>

        While the default namespace is set, any images you build without specifying a registry or username/organization 
        are pushed to the registry.

        To use this capability, write your deploy scripts like this:

        ```python example_deploy_script.py
        from prefect import flow
        from prefect.docker import DockerImage                                


        @flow(log_prints=True)                                                         
        def my_flow(name: str = "world"):
            print(f"Hello {name}! I'm a flow running on an Azure Container Instance!") 


        if __name__ == "__main__":
            my_flow.deploy(                                                            
                name="my-deployment",
                work_pool_name="my-work-pool",                                    
                image=DockerImage(                                                 
                    name="my-image:latest",                                       
                    platform="linux/amd64",                                            
                )                                                                 
            )       
        ```

        This builds an image with the tag `<acr-registry-url>/my-image:latest` and pushes it to the registry.

  <Tab title="Google Cloud Run">

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:
### Worker types

Below is a list of available worker types. Most worker types require installation of an additional package.

| Worker Type | Description | Required Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`process`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/workers/process/) | Executes flow runs in subprocesses | |
| [`kubernetes`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_kubernetes/worker/) | Executes flow runs as Kubernetes jobs | `prefect-kubernetes` |
| [`docker`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_docker/worker/) | Executes flow runs within Docker containers | `prefect-docker` |
| [`ecs`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_aws/workers/ecs_worker/) | Executes flow runs as ECS tasks | `prefect-aws` |
| [`cloud-run v2`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_gcp/workers/cloud_run_v2/) | Executes flow runs as Google Cloud Run jobs | `prefect-gcp` |
| [`vertex-ai`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_gcp/workers/vertex/) | Executes flow runs as Google Cloud Vertex AI jobs | `prefect-gcp` |
| [`azure-container-instance`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect_azure/workers/container_instance/) | Execute flow runs in ACI containers | `prefect-azure` |

If you don't see a worker type that meets your needs, consider 
[developing a new worker type](/contribute/develop-a-new-worker-type/).

### Worker status

Workers have two statuses: `ONLINE` and `OFFLINE`. A worker is online if it sends regular heartbeat messages to the Prefect API. 
If a worker misses three heartbeats, it is considered offline. By default, a worker is considered offline a maximum of 90 seconds 
after it stopped sending heartbeats, but you can configure the threshold with the `PREFECT_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` setting.

  <Tab title="Google Cloud Run">

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:
### Configure prefetch

By default, the worker submits flow runs a short time (10 seconds) before they are scheduled to run. 
This allows time for the infrastructure to be created so the flow run can start on time.

In some cases, infrastructure takes longer than 10 seconds to start the flow run. You can increase the prefetch with the 
`--prefetch-seconds` option or the `PREFECT_WORKER_PREFETCH_SECONDS` setting.

If this value is _more_ than the amount of time it takes for the infrastructure to start, the flow run will _wait_ until its 
scheduled start time.

### Polling for work

Workers poll for work every 15 seconds by default. You can configure this interval in your [profile settings](/3.0/manage/settings-and-profiles/) 
with the
`PREFECT_WORKER_QUERY_SECONDS` setting.

### Install policy

The Prefect CLI can install the required package for Prefect-maintained worker types automatically. Configure this behavior 
with the `--install-policy` option. The following are valid install policies:

| Install Policy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `always` | Always install the required package. Updates the required package to the most recent version if already installed. |
| `if-not-present` | Install the required package if it is not already installed. |
| `never` | Never install the required package. |
| `prompt` | Prompt the user to choose whether to install the required package. This is the default install policy. 
If `prefect worker start` is run non-interactively, the `prompt` install policy behaves the same as `never`. |
