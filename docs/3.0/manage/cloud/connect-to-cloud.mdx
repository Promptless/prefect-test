    <Tip>
    **Default Docker build namespace**
        After infrastructure provisioning completes, you are logged into your new Azure Container Registry and 
        the default Docker build namespace is set to the URL of the registry.
    </Tip>

        While the default namespace is set, any images you build without specifying a registry or username/organization 
        are pushed to the registry.

        To use this capability, write your deploy scripts like this:

        ```python example_deploy_script.py
        from prefect import flow
        from prefect.docker import DockerImage                                


        @flow(log_prints=True)                                                         
        def my_flow(name: str = "world"):
            print(f"Hello {name}! I'm a flow running on an Azure Container Instance!") 


        if __name__ == "__main__":
            my_flow.deploy(                                                            
                name="my-deployment",
                work_pool_name="my-work-pool",                                    
                image=DockerImage(                                                 
                    name="my-image:latest",                                       
                    platform="linux/amd64",                                            
                )                                                                 
            )       
        ```

        This builds an image with the tag `<acr-registry-url>/my-image:latest` and pushes it to the registry.

  <Tab title="Google Cloud Run">

```bash
prefect work-pool create --type cloud-run:push --provision-infra my-cloud-run-pool 
```

The `--provision-infra` flag allows you to select a GCP project to use for your work pool and automatically 
configures it to execute flows through Cloud Run.
In your GCP project, this command activates the Cloud Run API, creates a service account, and creates a key for the 
service account, (if they don't already exist).
In your Prefect workspace, this command creates a 
[`GCPCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-gcp/index#authenticate-using-a-gcp-credentials-block) to store the service account key.

Here's an abbreviated example output from running the command:
