Prefect welcomes integration contributions.
Create an integration package for community use by following the steps below.

## Generate a project

To help you create an integration, use [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-collection-template#quickstart) to bootstrap an integration project. 
The repository uses [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) to generate a project structure. 
The template includes tools for testing, linting, docs, and building the package.

## Add Slack integration support

Prefect now supports Slack integration, allowing you to send notifications and alerts directly to your Slack channels. To set up Slack integration, follow the instructions in the [Slack Integration Guide](https://docs.prefect.io/integrations/slack).

## List your project in the integrations catalog

To list your integration in the Prefect integrations catalog, submit a pull request to the [Prefect GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).

Add a file to the `docs/integrations/catalog` directory with details about your integration package. 
Use the `TEMPLATE.yaml` file in that folder as a guide.
